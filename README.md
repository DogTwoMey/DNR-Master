# DNR-master
The PyTorch implementation of DNR. If you use our code please cite "Consolidation of Structure of High Noise Data by a New Noise Index and Reinforcement Learning".

Method is tested on Circles dataset which is constructed by From_circles.py. 
Networks are trained using [PyTorch 1.0]and Python 3.7. 

Run TD3_circles.py to test our method.
